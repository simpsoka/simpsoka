Hi! My name is Kathy. I’m from Alaska, and I’m a product manager in San Francisco. I believe all great products are a result of effort that starts with a conversation. I've taken [products](http://www.kathy.pm/#shipped) from early prototypes to launch day consistently for the past 10 years. Through my successes (and failures) I've developed a [philosophy](http://www.kathy.pm/philosophy) about the path we take to make products that shine. My process thrives on the delicate dance between data driven design, business goals, and user feedback. I've worked with a lot of [great people](http://www.kathy.pm/#recs) through the years. Now I work at Vercel, and we build tools to help people build apps. [Say hi](http://www.kathy.pm/contact) 👍 😎.
